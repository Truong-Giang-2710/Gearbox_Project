📘 Mechanical Transmission System Design – Gearbox Project

🧑‍💻 Introduction
This is a personal project I undertook to strengthen my understanding and skills in the subject of Machine Elements / Mechanical Power Transmission System Design. The project focuses on the design and calculation of a complete mechanical transmission system including gears, shafts, bearings, keys, and the gearbox housing — commonly used in industrial machinery.
All calculations were performed manually, following mechanical engineering standards, design formulas, and technical tables learned throughout the course.

📚 Contents of the Work

I. Power Calculation & Transmission Characteristics
   Analyze working conditions and technical requirements
   Calculate power, torque, and load characteristics
   
II. Motor Selection & Transmission Ratio Distribution
   Select a suitable motor
   Determine the total transmission ratio and allocate it across the stages
   
III. Gear Train Design
   Select gear type: helical cylindrical gears
   Calculate key gear parameters: module, number of teeth, pitch, etc.
   Strength verification: contact stress and bending stress
   
IV. Shaft Design
   Define shaft layout and dimensions
   Calculate bending and torsional moments
   Stress analysis and deformation checks
   Key and spline design
   
V. Bearing Selection
   Choose bearing types based on load and speed
   Calculate bearing life and verify loading capacity
   
VI. Gearbox Housing Design
   Analyze the structure and function of the housing
   Design inspection holes, oil filling/draining holes
   Select bolts, locking rings, sealing elements, and auxiliary parts

🛠️ Tools & Methodologies Used
   Manual calculations based on Vietnamese/ISO mechanical standards
   Data from textbooks 
   Drafting in AutoCAD (optional)
   3D modeling in SolidWorks (for future enhancement)

🎯 Project Goals
   Mechanical design and calculation skills
   Develop a deep understanding of how individual machine elements work together in a transmission system
   Serve as a foundation for larger design projects or practical manufacturing applications
